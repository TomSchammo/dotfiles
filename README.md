# My Arch dotfiles

## About

This branch contains all the dotfiles that I have changed or added when I moved from Mint to Arch.

They will probably be integrated/merged into my main branch eventually (at least some of them, since the i3 config is universal for example),
but I'll have them separated for now until I clean things up.

# Setup

I currently use i3 as my window manager and no desktop environment, but this might change over time.
Alacritty is still my standard terminal emulator and I use neovim as my editor.
My neovim config, for example, stayed the same, so it's not included here.

I'll probably still work on my install scripts (especially for neovim) for debian based environments, but the ones for my arch install
will have priority. They're also much easier since I can just get the recent versions of software using the arch and community repos.
