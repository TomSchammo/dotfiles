# dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles.


## Dotfiles

~~Dotfiles in the master branch are mostly files that I've used on Debian based distributions
and work, or work on both Debian and Arch.~~

Currently on fedora, and I don't have the time to maintain all of this.
So I'll just push whatever works for me, and work on it from time to time,
but I don't have any devices that run Arch or Debian atm, so no guarantees.

## Scripts

~~Scripts in the master branch should work on Debian as well as Arch based systems.~~

Scripts are a little bit wonky overall, I'll have to fix those as some point...
